# CS F111 — Intro to Computer Programming
## taught by Dr. Pratik Narang

This is a repository to encapsulate everything covered in BITS Pilani's Intro to Computer Programming course. By the end of this semester, this repo will have been updated with notes from all lectures [see here](https://github.com/psrth/intro-to-programming-csF111/tree/main/lectures), as well as resources for lab work, practice assignments, and past papers.

If you want to collaborate, just open a PR and add onto the notes taken. Please try to be as concise as possible.

TODO: I'll probably deploy these to my website (psrth.co/csf111) using **Nextra** [see here](https://github.com/shuding/nextra). I'd have to be *really* bored to do this though, so don't count on it.

**Update 1:** I was way too over-optimistic about how frequently I'd actually be attending classes. I'm probably going to go through 23 lectures and 9 tutorials in one sprint and push tonight. Coffee goes brrr.
