## taught by Dr. Pratik Narang

This is a repository to encapsulate everything covered in BITS Pilani's Intro to Computer Programming course. By the end of this semester, this repo will have been updated with notes from all lectures [see here](https://github.com/psrth/intro-to-programming-csF111/tree/main/lectures), as well as resources for lab work, practice assignments, and past papers.

If you want to collaborate, just open a PR and add onto the notes taken. Please try to be as concise as possible.
