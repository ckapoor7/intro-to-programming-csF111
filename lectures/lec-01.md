### What is a computer?
*classical definition: a device that takes data as input, does some processing, and then returns an output*
A more realistic definition of a computer is anything that processes information. A bit of a history lesson — every invention in history has been to help humans with work. Before computers, all the inventions (like the wheel, the steam engine, the printing press) existed to help with *manual* work. The invention of the computer however, was to help humans with *thinking* work. On a granular level, all computers do is receive information, process that information, and then display or return the processed information.
