## Steps of Programming Practices
1. Requirements
**2. Creating a flow chart**
3. Creating algorithms
4. Writing code
5. Debugging
6. Documentation
7. Deployment

## So, what are flowcharts?
- Flowcharts are a graphical representation of a solution to a given problem
- Created by Von Neumann in 1945
- Symbolic diagrams showing data flow, control flow, and solution of a problem

**Flowcharts are espescially useful** in devising the logic for the program, the sequence of the flow, and the logic and algorthims before writing the program.

## How do we make a flowchart?
| Steps | Task |
| Step 1 | Identify the IO streams |
| Step 2 | Apply reasoning skills to solve the problem|
| Step 3 | Draw the flowchart using appropriate symbols and arrows to show sequence of steps required tosolve the problem|
